# pi.charm

### **Project Description**

This is my submission for the **Fusering Hack Club** event. 

1. The first design is based on the logo of my alt online persona, **pi.obj**.
Originally, the design was just a black background with yellow text using a custom font, but it quickly became one of my favorites. Converting those 2D aesthetics into a 3D object was kinda awsome !

2. The second one is my cool avatar that i got from notion, i had to do a lot of thinkering as it was originally a low res file, so had to run traces and turn into svg n stuff, and the dual tone printing is hella cool! so i designed this in black and white   

### **The Learning Process**

This project served as a great starter project to get familiar with **Fusion 360**. It was a vital warm-up exercise, as I’ll soon be designing a custom case for my keyboard project, **[pi.keeb](https://github.com/TreakeeOG/pi.keeb)**.

* **Time Spent:** ~3 hours
* **Things learned:** Basically the app, as I knew nothing about fusion.



> * The [official website](https://fusering.hackclub.com/) is a great help for dimensions.
> * You can quickly get used to the software by watching this video [here](https://youtu.be/qvrHuaHhqHI?si=BWXUiz0L6L53ONgL)

_**PS:** I really hope I get to see my keyring irl!_
